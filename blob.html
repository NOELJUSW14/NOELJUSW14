                    <div id="division">
                      <p>With such a wide range of experience I knew I wanted to meet and work with people from different cultures. My fondest
                          memories always involved traveling, experiencing cultural traditions, and food. So i literally sunk my teeth into my
                          passion. My first job out while in college was as a prep cook at a local golf club where i was blessed to have trained with a
                          local chef trained in French cuisine. For a year I learned the fundamentals of culinary arts, from the art of preparation also
                          known as “mise en place”, to the significance of fresh ingredients. I soaked in every minute, spending hours, sun up
                          to sun down watching and absorbing lessons that I use until this day. My heroes changed from grid iron legends like
                          Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, to culinary icons like Masaharu Morimoto and he late Anthony Bourdain. My weekends shifted
                          from yelling at the television, pleading my hometown Miami Hurricanes to beat Tim Tebow and his Florida Gators; to late
                          nights at the golf club bar watching chefs compete in Iron Chef America.</p>
                      
                          <p>I was young, hungry (literally sometimes), and impressionable. It was an amazing time to be open minded and that experience
                          lead me to places I would never imagined. It is embedded in my DNA and even though I gave up my spatula and knife for a
                          MacBook. My fire and desire to create is still burning hot. I just found a different kitchen to cook in.</p>
