              <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                  <li>With such a wide range of experience I knew I wanted to meet and work with people from different cultures. My fondest</li>
                  <li>memories always involved traveling, experiencing cultural traditions, and food. So i literally sunk my teeth into my</li>
                  <li>passion. My first job out while in college was as a prep cook at a local golf club where i was blessed to have trained with a</li>
                  <li>local chef trained in French cuisine. For a year I learned the fundamentals of culinary arts, from the art of preparation also</li>
                  <li>known as “mise en place”, to the significance of fresh ingredients. I soaked in every minute, spending hours, sun up</li>
                  <li>to sun down watching and absorbing lessons that I use until this day. My heroes changed from grid iron legends like</li>
                  <li>Jerry Rice and Randy Moss, to culinary icons like Masaharu Morimoto and he late Anthony Bourdain. My weekends shifted</li>
                  <li>from yelling at the television, pleading my hometown Miami Hurricanes to beat Tim Tebow and his Florida Gators; to late</li>
                  <li>nights at the golf club bar watching chefs compete in Iron Chef America.</li>

                  <li>I was young, hungry (literally sometimes), and impressionable. It was an amazing time to be open minded and that experience</li>
                  <li>lead me to places I would never imagined. It is embedded in my DNA and even though I gave up my spatula and knife for a</li>
                  <li>MacBook. My fire and desire to create is still burning hot. I just found a different kitchen to cook in.</li>
