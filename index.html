            <p>My first job was as prep cook at a local golf club, while I was a freshman at Daytona State College. Who would have guessed that the lessons I will go on to learn would take me so far.</p>
            <p>For a year I trained in culinary fundamentals like “mise en place”- the art of preperation, metric conversions, time management and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>It was an amazing time to be open minded and naive. I soon gave up my spatula and knife for inventory management softwares and a MacBook</p>
            <p>Im inspired by the sucess of programmers like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg but haven't traded in my culinary heros like Masaharu Morimoto and the late Anthony Bourdain</p>
            <p>My fire and desire to create is still burning hot. I just found a different kitchen to cook in.</p>
